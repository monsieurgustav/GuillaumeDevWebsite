# An interactive experience

A Kinect animation for the launch of the new Nina Rouge.

An interactive experience where customers could virtually grab the red apple on a screen, play with it and share their video on social media.

# Tech

A [Unity](https://unity.com/) application using a [Kinect](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/kinect/) for user detection.

The application acts as a magic mirror: the red apple and the UI are drawn on the video stream.

The user can grab the virtual red apple. To smoothen the interaction, the detection is done in 2D space: the user relies on the screen feedback to grab the apple.

Developped for [Byzance](https://byzance.world/portfolio/nina-ricci-nina-rouge/).
